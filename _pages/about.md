I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of CCDS](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/), [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I have not published any papers yet â€” NeurIPS 2025 is my first submission attempt.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. XXX](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
