I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of CCDS](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/), [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I have not published any papers yet â€” NeurIPS 2025 is my first submission attempt.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sheng Lian of XXX Lab from Fuzhou University.
